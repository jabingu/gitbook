<p><strong>Elastic-Cache: GPU Cache Architecture for Efficient Fine- and Coarse-Grained Cache-Line Management.</strong> </p>
<blockquote>
<p>&#x200B;    Bingchao Li, Jizhou Sun, Murali Annavaram, Nam Sung Kim:</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>GPUs</strong> provide high-bandwidth/low-latency on-chip shared memory and L1 cache to efficiently service a large number of concurrent memory requests (to contiguous memory space). To support warp-wide accesses to L1 cache, GPU L1 cache lines are very wide. However, such L1 cache architecture cannot always be efficiently utilized when applications generate many memory requests with irregular access patterns especially due to branch and memory divergences. In this paper, we propose Elastic-Cache that can efficiently support both fine- and coarse-grained L1 cache-line management for applications with both regular and irregular memory access patterns. Specifically, it can store 32- or 64-byte words in non-contiguous memory space to a single 128-byte cache line. Furthermore, it neither requires an extra tag storage structure nor reduces the capacity of L1 cache since it stores auxiliary tags for fine-grained L1 cache-line managements in sharedmemory space that is not fully used in many applications. Our experiment shows that Elastic-Cache improves the geo-mean performance of applications with irregular memory access patterns by 58% without degrading performance of applications with regular memory access patterns.</p>

<p><strong>Content-Aware Non-Volatile Cache Replacement.</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>&#x200B;    Qi Zeng, Jih-Kwon Peir:</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Spin-Transfer Torque Magnetoresistive Random-Access Memory (STT-MRAM) is a promising memory technology, which has high density, fast read speed, low leakage power, and non-volatility, and is suitable for multi-core on-chip last-level caches. However, the high write energy and latency, as well as less-than-desirable write endurance of STT-MRAM remain challenges. This paper proposes a new encoded content-aware cache replacement policy to reduce the total switch bits for write, lower the write energy, and improve write endurance. Instead of replacing the LRU block under the conventional pseudo-LRU replacement policy, we select a replacement block near the LRU position, which has the most similar content to the missed block. The selected replacement block can reduce the switch bits without damaging the cache performance. To avoid fetching and comparing the entire block contents, we present a novel content encoding method to encode 64-byte block using just 8 bits, each bit represents 8-byte content. The encoded bit is determined by the presence of a dominant bit value in the 8 bytes. We measure the content similarity using the Hamming distance between the encoded bits of the missed block and the replaced block. Performance evaluation demonstrates that the proposed simple content encoding method is effective with an average of 20.5% reduction in total switch bits, which results in improvement on write endurance and less write energy consumption. These improvements are accomplished with low overhead and minimum impact on the cache performance.</p>

<p><strong>DEFT-Cache: A Cost-Effective and Highly Reliable SSD Cache for RAID Storage.</strong> </p>
<blockquote>
<p>&#x200B;    Jiguang Wan, Wei Wu, Ling Zhan, Qing Yang, Xiaoyang Qu, Changsheng Xie:</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This paper proposes a new SSD cache architecture, DEFT-cache, Delayed Erasing and Fast Taping, that maximizes I/O performance and reliability of RAID storage. First of all, DEFT-Cache exploits the inherent physical properties of flash memory SSD by making use of old data that have been overwritten but still in existence in SSD to minimize small write penalty of RAID5/6. As data pages being overwritten in SSD, old data pages are invalidated and become candidates for erasure and garbage collections. Our idea is to selectively delay the erasure of the pages and let these otherwise useless old data in SSD contribute to I/O performance for parity computations upon write I/Os. Secondly, DEFT-Cache provides inexpensive redundancy to the SSD cache by having one physical SSD and one virtual SSD as a mirror cache. The virtual SSD is implemented on HDD but using log-structured data layout, i.e. write data are quickly logged to HDD using sequential write. The dual and redundant caches provide a cost-effective and highly reliable write-back SSD cache. We have implemented DEFT-Cache on Linux system. Extensive experiments have been carried out to evaluate the potential benefits of our new techniques. Experimental results on SPC and Microsoft traces have shown that DEFT-Cache improves I/O performance by 26.81% to 56.26% in terms of average user response time. The virtual SSD mirror cache can absorb write I/Os as fast as physical SSD providing the same reliability as two physical SSD caches without noticeable performance loss.</p>

<p><strong>Adaptive Software Caching for Efficient NVRAM Data Persistence.</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>&#x200B;    Pengcheng Li, Dhruva R. Chakrabarti, Chen Ding, Liang Yuan:</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Non-volatile main memory (NVRAM) enables data persistence in memory. However, the existence of transient CPU caches in modern computer architectures brings a serious performance issue. In particular, cache lines have to be flushed frequently to guarantee consistent persistent program states. Hence, persistence and performance cannot be easily obtained simultaneously. In this paper, we optimize data persistence by proposing a software cache. The software cache first buffers lines that need to be flushed, and then flushes them out at an appropriate later time. The software cache aims to maximize the combination of cache line flushes. We designed a new linear-time algorithm to calculate cache miss ratio curve (MRC) so as to adaptively select the best cache capacity at run-time based on program behavior. We evaluated the software cache on a real-world memory-based database benchmark, the SPLASH2 benchmark suite and four micro-benchmarks. Results indicate that the software cache solution reduces cache write backs to persistent memory by 12&#xD7; and improves performance over the state-of- the-art methods by 2.1&#xD7; on average, measured on a real system emulator.</p>

<p><strong>Elastic Data Compression with Improved Performance and Space Efficiency for Flash-Based Storage Systems.</strong> </p>
<blockquote>
<p>&#x200B;    Bo Mao, Hong Jiang, Suzhen Wu, Yaodong Yang, Zaifa Xi:</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Data compression has become a commodity feature for space efficiency and reliability in flash-based storage systems by reducing write traffic and space capacity demand. However, it introduces noticeable processing overheads on the critical I/O path, which degrades the system performance significantly. Existing data compression schemes for flash-based storage systems use fixed compression algorithms for all the incoming write data, failing to recognize and exploit the significant diversity in compressibility and access patterns of data and missing an opportunity to improve the system performance, the space efficiency or both. To achieve a reasonable trade-off between these two important design objectives, in this paper we introduce an Elastic Data Compression scheme, called EDC, which exploits the data compressibility and access intensity characteristics by judiciously matching data of different compressibility with different compression algorithms while leveraging the access idleness. Specifically, for compressible data blocks EDC exploits the compression diversity of the workload, and employs algorithms of higher compression rate in periods of lower system utilization and algorithms of lower compression rate in periods of higher system utilization. For non-compressible (or very lowly compressible) data blocks, it will write them through to the flash storage directly without any compression. The experiments conducted on our lightweight prototype implementation of the EDC system show that EDC saves storage space by up to 38.7%, with an average of 33.7%. In addition, it significantly outperforms the fixed compression schemes in the I/O performance measure by up to 61.4%, with an average of 36.7%.</p>

<p><strong>E^2MC: Entropy Encoding Based Memory Compression for GPUs.</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Sohan Lal, Jan Lucas, Ben H. H. Juurlink:</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Modern Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) provide much higher off-chip memory bandwidth than CPUs, but many GPU applications are still limited by memory bandwidth. Unfortunately, off-chip memory bandwidth is growing slower than the number of cores and has become a performance bottleneck. Thus, optimizations of effective memory bandwidth play a significant role for scaling the performance of GPUs. Memory compression is a promising approach for improving memory bandwidth which can translate into higher performance and energy efficiency. However, compression is not free and its challenges need to be addressed, otherwise the benefits of compression may be offset by its overhead. We propose an entropy encoding based memory compression (E2MC) technique for GPUs, which is based on the well-known Huffman encoding. We study the feasibility of entropy encoding for GPUs and show that it achieves higher compression ratios than state-of-the-art GPU compression techniques. Furthermore, we address the key challenges of probability estimation, choosing an appropriate symbol length for encoding, and decompression with low latency. The average compression ratio of E2MC is 53% higher than the state of the art. This translates into an average speedup of 20% compared to no compression and 8% higher compared to the state of the art. Energy consumption and energy-delayproduct are reduced by 13% and 27%, respectively. Moreover, the compression ratio achieved by E2MC is close to the optimal compression ratio given by Shannon&apos;s source coding theorem.</p>

<p><strong>Significantly Improving Lossy Compression for Scientific Data Sets Based on Multidimensional Prediction and Error-Controlled Quantization.</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Dingwen Tao, Sheng Di, Zizhong Chen, Franck Cappello:</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Today&apos;s HPC applications are producing extremely large amounts of data, such that data storage and analysis are becoming more challenging for scientific research. In this work, we design a new error-controlled lossy compression algorithm for large-scale scientific data. Our key contribution is significantly improving the prediction hitting rate (or prediction accuracy) for each data point based on its nearby data values along multiple dimensions. We derive a series of multilayer prediction formulas and their unified formula in the context of data compression. One serious challenge is that the data prediction has to be performed based on the preceding decompressed values during the compression in order to guarantee the error bounds, which may degrade the prediction accuracy in turn. We explore the best layer for the prediction by considering the impact of compression errors on the prediction accuracy. Moreover, we propose an adaptive error-controlled quantization encoder, which can further improve the prediction hitting rate considerably. The data size can be reduced significantly after performing the variable-length encoding because of the uneven distribution produced by our quantization encoder. We evaluate the new compressor on production scientific data sets and compare it with many other state-of-the-art compressors: GZIP, FPZIP, ZFP, SZ-1.1, and ISABELA. Experiments show that our compressor is the best in class, especially with regard to compression factors (or bit-rates) and compression errors (including RMSE, NRMSE, and PSNR). Our solution is better than the second-best solution by more than a 2x increase in the compression factor and 3.8x reduction in the normalized root mean squared error on average, with reasonable error bounds and user-desired bit-rates.</p>

<p><strong>ATM: Approximate Task Memoization in the Runtime System.</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>&#x200B;    Iulian Brumar, Marc Casas, Miquel Moret&#xF3;, Mateo Valero, Gurindar S. Sohi:</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Redundant computations appear during the execution of real programs. Multiple factors contribute to these unnecessary computations, such as repetitive inputs and patterns, calling functions with the same parameters or bad programming habits. Compilers minimize non useful code with static analysis. However, redundant execution might be dynamic and there are no current approaches to reduce these inefficiencies. Additionally, many algorithms can be computed with different levels of accuracy. Approximate computing exploits this fact to reduce execution time at the cost of slightly less accurate results. In this case, expert developers determine the desired tradeoff between performance and accuracy for each application. In this paper, we present Approximate Task Memoization (ATM), a novel approach in the runtime system that transparently exploits both dynamic redundancy and approximation at the task granularity of a parallel application. Memoization of previous task executions allows predicting the results of future tasks without having to execute them and without losing accuracy. To further increase performance improvements, the runtime system can memoize similar tasks, which leads to task approximate computing. By defining how to measure task similarity and correctness, we present an adaptive algorithm in the runtime system that automatically decides if task approximation is beneficial or not. When evaluated on a real 8-core processor with applications from different domains (financial analysis, stencil-computation, machine-learning and linear-algebra), ATM achieves a 1.4x average speedup when only applying memoization techniques. When adding task approximation, ATM achieves a 2.5x average speedup with an average 0.7% accuracy loss (maximum of 3.2%).</p>

</blockquote>
<p>A surprising development in recently announced HPC platforms is the addition of, sometimes massive amounts of, persistent (nonvolatile) memory (NVM) in order to increase memory capacity and compensate for plateauing I/O capabilities. However, there are no portable and scalable programming interfaces using aggregate NVM effectively. This paper introduces Papyrus: a new software system built to exploit emerging capability of NVM in HPC architectures. Papyrus (or Parallel Aggregate Persistent -YRU- Storage) is a novel programming system that provides features for scalable, aggregate, persistent memory in an extreme-scale system for typical HPC usage scenarios. Papyrus mainly consists of Papyrus Virtual File System (VFS) and Papyrus Template Container Library (TCL). Papyrus VFS provides a uniform aggregate NVM storage image across diverse NVM architectures. It enables Papyrus TCL to provide a portable and scalable high-level container programming interface whose data elements are distributed across multiple NVM nodes without requiring the user to handle complex communication, synchronization, replication, and consistency model. We evaluate Papyrus on two HPC systems, including UTK Beacon and NERSC Cori, using real NVM storage devices.</p>

<p><strong>Language-Based Optimizations for Persistence on Nonvolatile Main Memory Systems.</strong> </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Joel Edward Denny, Seyong Lee, Jeffrey S. Vetter:</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Substantial advances in nonvolatile memory (NVM) technologies have motivated wide-spread integration of NVM into mobile, enterprise, and HPC systems. Recently, considerable research has focused on architectural integration of NVM and respective programming systems, exploiting NVM&apos;s trait of persistence correctly and efficiently. In this regard, we design several novel language-based optimization techniques for programming NVM and demonstrate them as an extension of our NVL-C system. Specifically, we focus on optimizing the performance of atomic updates to complex data structures residing in NVM. We build on two variants of automatic undo logging: canonical undo logging, and shadow updates. We show these techniques can be implemented transparently and efficiently, using dynamic selection and other logging optimizations. Our empirical results on several applications gathered on an NVM testbed illustrate that our cost-model-based dynamic selection technique can accurately choose the best logging variant across different NVM modes and input sizes. In comparison to statically choosing canonical undo logging, this improvement reduces execution time to as little as 53% for block-addressable NVM and 73% for emulated byte-addressable NVM on a Fusion-io ioScale device.</p>

<p><strong>MetaKV: A Key-Value Store for Metadata Management of Distributed Burst Buffers.</strong> </p>
<blockquote>

<p>Distributed burst buffers are a promising storage architecture for handling I/O workloads for exascale computing. Their aggregate storage bandwidth grows linearly with system node count. However, although scientific applications can achieve scalable write bandwidth by having each process write to its node-local burst buffer, metadata challenges remain formidable, especially for files shared across many processes. This is due to the need to track and organize file segments across the distributed burst buffers in a global index. Because this global index can be accessed concurrently by thousands or more processes in a scientific application, the scalability of metadata management is a severe performance-limiting factor. In this paper, we propose MetaKV: a key-value store that provides fast and scalable metadata management for HPC metadata workloads on distributed burst buffers. MetaKV complements the functionality of an existing key-value store with specialized metadata services that efficiently handle bursty and concurrent metadata workloads: compressed storage management, supervised block clustering, and log-ring based collective message reduction. Our experiments demonstrate that MetaKV outperforms the state-of-the-art key-value stores by a significant margin. It improves put and get metadata operations by as much as 2.66&#xD7; and 6.29&#xD7;, respectively, and the benefits of MetaKV increase with increasing metadata workload demand.</p>

<p><strong>Parallelism and Garbage Collection Aware I/O Scheduler with Improved SSD Performance.</strong> </p>
<blockquote>
<p>&#x200B;    Jiayang Guo, Yiming Hu, Bo Mao, Suzhen Wu:</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In this paper, we propose PGIS, a parallelism and garbage collection aware I/O Scheduler, which identifies the hot data based on trace characteristics to exploit the channel level internal parallelism of flash-based storage systems. PGIS not only fully exploits abundant channel resource in the SSD, but also it introduces a hot data identification mechanism to reduce the garbage collection overhead. By dispatching hot read data to different channel, the channel level internal parallelism is fully exploited. By dispatching hot write data to the same physical block, the garbage collection overhead has been alleviated. The experiment results show that compared with existing I/O schedulers, PGIS improves the response time and garbage collection performance significantly. Consequently, PGIS reduces the garbage collection overhead up to 30.9%, while exploiting channel level internal parallelism.</p>
